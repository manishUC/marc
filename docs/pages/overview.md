## Why did we develop this library

A few years ago when we started to move away from monoliths to microservices ecosystem, we faced a bunch of problems:
* What and how to standardise microservices for the entire engg team
* How do we ensure our engineers only focus on business logic abstracting out the nitty gritties of components
* Keeping components easy to configure and more importantly intuitive 

We build this library with years of understanding and issues we faced with microservices ecosystem. In fact we are still using it here for everything backend!
